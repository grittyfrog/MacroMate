# Macro Mate

Macro Mate is a plugin for Final Fantasy XIV. It lets you store and run an unlimited number of macros. You can also bind macros to normal macro slots.

For example, you can:

- Automatically swap in the correct raid macro when you enter an instance
- Store longer macros and automatically split them across multiple macro slots.
- Use almost any icon in the game for your Macros


# Limitations

Macro Mate does not extend the macro system in any way and macros are executed identically to the base game.

You can store macros that are longer then 15 lines, but macros must still be
executed in 15-line chunks, and longer macros will need to be linked to multiple macro slots.

Macro Mate is not designed for conditional combat actions. Conditions that are primarily
used for dynamically swapping combat actions are out of scope and will not be introduced in this
plugin.
