description: |
  Macro Mate lets you store and run an unlimited number of macros. You can also bind macros to normal macro slots.

  For example, you can:

  - Automatically swap in the correct raid macro when you enter an instance
  - Store longer macros and automatically split them across multiple macro slots.
  - Use almost any icon in the game for your Macros
